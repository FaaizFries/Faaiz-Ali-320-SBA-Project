for this sba I have created a react app using the open weather api that was provided in the sba instructions. I have created a weather app in which all you have to do is enter what city you want and it will display the temprature, wind speed, and humidity. I am hosting it on netlify so here is the link for the app.  https://faaiz-ali-weather-app-sba.netlify.app/  . 
I have also commented small explantions on my code on how everything works. the tecnolgies i have used to create this was really just relearning how to make api calls. the aproach i have taken for this project was orginaly working on a marvel comic api but i couldnt get the key to work. i ended up figuring out how to create a weather app through many youtube tutorials and started working from what ive learned.
